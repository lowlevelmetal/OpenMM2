# Parity audit: OpenMM2-only

Audited against MM2Recomp (midtown2.exe build 3393) on 2026-10-07.

This area holds the 112 files classified O (OpenMM2-only): the platform
layer, the render backends and helpers, the network transport, game-source
detection, the video decoders, `src/core` helpers, the app shell and the
tools. Every file was checked for game behaviour: read in full, except the
render backends, the Indeo decoder and the network transport, which are API
plumbing, a translation of FFmpeg's decoder and the ENet/UPnP layer, and were
searched for anything the game would see (render-state mappings, colour
space, constants, timing, settings). Eight groups carry game behaviour: the
frame time step and the main loop's handling of an inactive window, the
audio options' effect on the mixer, the order in which archives override
each other, the camera projection, mipmap generation, joystick axis scaling
and the number parsing the data loaders use. Those functions were audited
against MM2 like the P files and their files are reclassified M below.

Summary: 34 functions; verified 6, fixed 8, deviation 5, inferred 4, open 1,
openmm2 10.

## Frame timing and the main loop

`src/app/App.cpp`, `src/platform/Clock.*`, `src/platform/Platform.*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FrameClock::tick` | `datTimeManager::Update`, `datTimeManager::RealTime` (called with 0 by `MainPhase`) | fixed | The game runs in real time: each frame's Seconds is the measured frame time held to ClampMin 0.0001 s .. ClampMax 0.1 s. OpenMM2 clamped to 0.25 s with no minimum, so a hitch between 0.1 and 0.25 s advanced the AI, timers, camera and physics by more than the original allows. Now 0.0001 .. 0.1 s (`kMinFrameSeconds`, `kMaxFrameSeconds`). The very first frame of the process (MM2's FirstFrame, which uses the sample step, i.e. ClampMin) is not reproduced; it only affects the first frame of the intro. Test: `FrameClockParity.ClampsToMM2FrameLimits`. |
| `app::run`: frame loop while another application is active (`freezesWhenInactive`) | `gfxPipeline::gfxWindowProc` (WM_ACTIVATEAPP sets the inactive event flag), `gfxPipeline::Manage` (blocks in GetMessage while inactive), `GameLoop` | fixed | MM2 stands still while inactive: no time step, no update, no drawing, and its DirectSound buffers (created without global or sticky focus, `audSound::CreateSoundBufferFromFile`) are muted by DirectSound. OpenMM2 kept simulating and playing sound while alt-tabbed. Now the loop waits for events without ticking the clock and pauses the audio device; the first frame after reactivation measures the whole pause, which the clock holds to 0.1 s (as MM2's next datTimeManager::Update does). The first-run setup screen (no game data) keeps running. |
| `app::run`: inactive window in multiplayer and automation runs | the lost-focus callback `mmGameMulti::Init` installs (`gfxPipeline_SetLostCallback`) | deviation | In a multiplayer race MM2 closes the network session (`asNetwork::CloseSession`) when it loses focus and tells the game manager to leave (inferred from the call; its meaning is not traced further). OpenMM2 keeps running and connected (freezing would stall the other players). `--frames` and `OPENMM2_FRONTEND_SCRIPT` runs also keep running, since they may never have focus. |
| `app::run`: per-frame order | `GameLoop` | verified | MM2: time step, input poll, window messages, events, audio manager, `asRoot::Update`, draw. OpenMM2: events and input, time step, screen update, draw; the audio mixer runs on its own thread. Same order for everything the game reads. |
| `app::run`: whether the intro plays | start-up code before `MainPhase` (`-nomovie`, `inWindow`), `ebolaPlayMovie` | deviation | MM2 plays `logos.avi` on every start unless run with `-nomovie` (OpenMM2: `--skip-intro` or `[Game] SkipIntro`) or in a window (`-window`). OpenMM2 draws the movie itself and plays it in every window mode. The comment that claimed any key skips it was wrong (see Missing). |
| `app::run`: `--quickstart`, `--frames`, `--screenshot`, `OPENMM2_DEBUG_VEHICLE` | | openmm2 | Development and automation aids. |
| `FrameLimiter` | | openmm2 | Optional frame cap; MM2 has none (the 0.0001 s minimum step aside). It only sleeps and does not change the time step. |
| `platform::waitForEvents` | `GetMessageA` in `gfxPipeline::Manage` | openmm2 | SDL helper for the inactive wait. |

## Input

`src/platform/Input.*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Input::updateDevices`: axis scaling | `mmJoystick::inputPrepareDevice`, `mmJoystick::Poll`, `mmJaxis::SetRange`, `mmJaxis::Normalize`, `mmJoystick::GetAxis` | verified | MM2 asks DirectInput for -2000..2000 on X, Y, Z and Rz and maps linearly to -1..1; OpenMM2 maps SDL's -32768..32767 linearly (clamped). Splitting an axis into its two halves (`GetAxis` codes 0x11..0x14) is the session area's input mapping. |
| dead zone | `mmJoystick::SetDeadZone`, `mmInput::Init`, `mmInput::SetDeadZone` | open | MM2 sets DirectInput's dead zone on the X and Y axes to mmInput +0x1b4 × 10000 (0.1 by default, set in `mmInput::mmInput`; the Options dead-zone slider), applied by DirectInput before the game reads the axis. OpenMM2 applies no dead zone at the device layer; `RaceScreen` uses a fixed 0.15 threshold on the left stick without rescaling and ignores the stored `DeadZone` option. Belongs to the session and frontend areas (the input mapping lives in `RaceScreen`). |
| `Input::handleEvent`: key down/up edges, auto-repeat ignored | `ioKeyboard::Update` | inferred | MM2 reads DirectInput keyboard state, which has no auto-repeat; OpenMM2 ignores repeat events. |
| `Input::handleEvent`: keys released on focus loss | DirectInput devices are unacquired when the window is inactive | inferred | Windows behaviour. |
| device enumeration, key names, rumble | `ioJoystick::EnumDeviceProc` | openmm2 | MM2 special-cases a few 2000-era pads by name; SDL's gamepad mappings replace that. The rumble functions are unused (see Missing). |

## Audio options

`src/app/Context.cpp`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Context::applyAudioSettings`: SOUND FX toggle | `AudioOptions::SetAudioState`, `AudioOptions::SetSoundFX`, the wave mute in AudManager (linker-folded under the name `AudManager::GetMixerPtr`), `audManager::SetVolAllSounds`, `AudSoundBase::AudSoundBase`, `AudSpeech::AudSpeech` | fixed | SOUND FX off sets the volume of every AudSoundBase sound to zero, the same class of sounds `AudManager::AssignWaveVolume` scales. Commentary is played by AudSpeech through AudStream, an AudSoundBase, so it falls silent too; OpenMM2 muted only effects and engines. Now the voice bus needs both SOUND FX and COMMENTARY. Test: `AudioOptionsParity.SoundFxToggleSilencesCommentaryToo`. Not reproduced: with SOUND FX off at start-up MM2 never initialises the wave audio (`InitAudioManager` gets the flag), so switching it on has no effect until the next start; OpenMM2 applies it at once. |
| `Context::applyAudioSettings`: volumes, balance, master | `AudioOptions::SetSFXVolume`, `AudioOptions::SetMusicVolume`, `AudioOptions::SetBalance`, `AudManager::AssignWaveVolume`, `DMusicManager::SetVolume` | verified | Same buses as MM2 (wave volume on effects, engines and voices; music volume on DirectMusic; balance on both). The mixer now applies MM2's `AudManager::AssignWaveVolume` curve to the slider values itself (audio audit); the master volume is an OpenMM2 extra. STEREO FX reaches the mixer (`Mixer::setStereo`: mono centres every voice, surround plays as stereo, `AudioOptions::SetStereoFX`). |
| `Context::applyAudioSettings`: `Bus::Ambient` | `mmAmbientAudio::Update`, `MMDMusicManager::UpdateAmbientSFX` | fixed | The bus carried both the wave ambient sounds (rain, thunder, the city's ambient loops: AudSoundBase sounds, so MM2 scales them with SOUND FX VOLUME and silences them with SOUND FX off) and the DirectMusic ambience segment (MUSIC volume). The audio audit moved the wave sounds to `Bus::Effects`; `Bus::Ambient` now carries only the segment, at the MUSIC volume while CITY SOUNDS is on. The separate, unexposed `[Audio] Ambient` volume is gone (the MUSIC slider wrote it with the music volume). |
| `Context::music`, `shutdownMusic`, `saveSettings`, `loadGameData` | | openmm2 | Glue. |

## Game data mounting

`src/vfs/GameSource.*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `listArchives`, `probeImage`: archive order (`sortLikeMM2`) | `zipMultiAutoInit` | fixed | MM2 finds every `*.ar` in its folder, upper-cases the paths and sorts them with strcmp. OpenMM2 put the four retail archives first in a fixed order and any others after them in lower-case order. Now one list in upper-case byte order. Test: `GameSourceParity.ArchivesAreSearchedInUpperCaseNameOrder`. |
| `mountGameSource`: which archive wins | `zipMultiAutoInit`, `zipFile::zipFile` (pushes onto the front of the archive list), `zipFile::zipOpen` (searches from the front) | fixed | The archives are created from the last in sorted order to the first, so the search runs in sorted order and the first archive holding a file wins. OpenMM2 let add-on archives override the retail ones and later names override earlier ones; an add-on named after `MM2TEX.AR` now only adds files, one named before `MM2AUD.AR` overrides. The retail archives share no paths (checked against the disc), so retail data is unaffected. Test: `GameSourceParity.FirstArchiveWinsAndLooseFilesAreIgnored`. |
| `mountGameSource`: loose files | `zipFile::Init` (replaces `Stream`'s default open methods with the archive methods) | fixed | Once an archive is open, game data is only ever read from archives. OpenMM2 mounted the installation folder above every archive, so loose files overrode archive content. Removed. |
| `mountGameSource`: required archives | | openmm2 | Validation of the source. |
| `probeGameSource`, `openSourceFile`, `suggestGameSources`, `GameSource::describe` | | openmm2 | Disc, image and install detection. |

## String helpers

`src/core/StringUtil.*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `str::parseDouble` (then cast to float) | `datAsciiTokenizer::GetFloat` (`atof`, then float) | verified | Same value for a well-formed number (both parse to double and round to float). Stricter: a token with trailing characters fails where atof reads its numeric prefix. Each loader in the formats and city areas decides how to handle that. |
| `str::parseInt` | `datAsciiTokenizer::GetInt` (`atoi`) | deviation | Accepts `0x` hex and rejects trailing text ("12.5", "4 State") where atoi reads the leading digits. Loaders that need atoi's behaviour do it themselves (`ui::MenuLayout`, `game::session::RaceSetup`). |
| `str::iequals`, `str::lower`, `str::upper` | `_stricmp`, `_strupr` (C locale) | verified | ASCII-only case folding in both. |
| `trim`, `split`, `normalizeVirtualPath`, `toPath`, `fromPath`, `parseBool` | | openmm2 | |

## Rendering helpers

`src/render/Projection.*`, `src/render/ImageUtil.*`, the backends.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `computeProjection` (`FovMode::HorPlus`, the default) | `gfxViewport::Perspective`, `gfxViewport::SetWindow`, `asCamera::SetView` | verified | MM2's camera FOV is vertical: y is scaled by 1 / tan(fov / 2) and x by that over the viewport's width / height, so wider viewports see more at the sides. OpenMM2 carries the FOV as its 4:3 horizontal equivalent (`cam::horizontalFov4x3`) and HorPlus converts it back, giving the same projection up to float rounding. The header comment claimed Angel cameras use a horizontal FOV; corrected. |
| `computeProjection` (`VertMinus`, `Stretch`, `maxAspect`) | | deviation | OpenMM2 display options for wide screens. |
| `computeUiLayout`, `scaledExtent` | | deviation | Any-resolution UI scaling and render scale (OpenMM2 extras); `Fit` and `Stretch` equal the original on a 4:3 screen. |
| `render::downsample`, `buildMipChain` | `gfxImage::GenerateMipmaps` (called by `gfxLoadJPEGImage`, `gfxLoadTargaImage`, `gfxLoadBmpImage` when mipmaps are asked for) | fixed | MM2 averages each 2x2 block per channel as the sum shifted right by two (truncated); OpenMM2 rounded ((sum + 2) / 4), making every generated level up to one step brighter per level. Now truncated. Which textures get generated mipmaps at all is `game::TextureLibrary`'s decision (rendering-fx area). Test: `ImageUtil.DownsampleAverages`. |
| Blend, depth and sampler mapping in `GlDevice` and `VulkanDevice` | render states as defined by `render/Types.h` (rendering-fx area) | openmm2 | Checked that both backends implement every `BlendMode` and `Filter` the same way and as `Types.h` documents them, and that output is gamma-space (UNORM, no sRGB conversion) as on MM2's Direct3D. |

## Video

`src/video/*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Movie::decodeNext`: empty and null frames repeat the last picture | `ebolaPlayMovie` (MCIWnd, Video for Windows) | inferred | Playback was done by Windows and the system's Indeo codec, not by `midtown2.exe`. |
| `Indeo5Decoder`, `AviFile` | the system's Indeo 5 codec and AVI reader | inferred | Bit-identical to FFmpeg's decoder (docs/video.md). |

## Network

`src/net/*`.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SessionSettings` defaults, `SnapshotBuffer` interpolation | DirectPlay transport, `mmNetObject` | openmm2 | The transport carries no rules: `game::NetGame::toSessionSettings` (session area) fills every setting from the race configuration, and remote cars' rules live in `game/net`. Notes for the session area: the protocol allows 16 players and `NetGame` clamps to 2..16 where MM2 allowed 8; traffic and pedestrian densities cross the wire as whole percent. |

## Shared traffic of a network cruise

Added 2026-10-09 on the maintainer's decision (2026-10-09: the traffic and
police are shared, host-authoritative, a host option in the lobby, on by
default). MM2's network cruise has neither: `mmGameMulti::Init` zeroes the
traffic, cop and opponent densities and the cable cars, and each machine runs
its own pedestrians. OpenMM2 keeps that exactly with the option off. With it
on, the host runs the cruise's traffic and police for every player and the
clients show them (docs/multiplayer.md, "Shared traffic"). These rows are not
counted in the summary above.

| OpenMM2 | MM2 | Verdict | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `RaceScreen::loadAi`, `spawnPolice` in a network cruise | `mmGameMulti::Init` (no traffic, police, racers or rail cars) | deviation | The host keeps its traffic density and the cruise's police posts (`RaceSetup`: the posts of the cruise's `.aimap` at the cop density, as single-player cruise); a client runs neither. Cops and Robbers and the network races are unchanged; the cable cars stay off. |
| `ai::Traffic::step` with several players, `World::setOtherPlayers` | `aiMap::Update`, `aiMap::AddPlayer`, `aiMap::RemovePlayer`, `aiPath::AddAmbPlayer` / `RemAmbPlayer`, `aiGoalRandomDrive::Update`, `aiGoalRegainRail::Update`, `aiGoalAvoidPlayer` (+0xe6), the pose solver's player loop | deviation | MM2's own player list, which a single-player game fills with one player and its network games with only the local one. OpenMM2 lists the other players' cars on the host, in 16 slots where aiMap has four. A player gone from the list gives up its roads from the room they were populated for (`RemovePlayer` asks the room of its car's place; inferred equivalent). The pedestrians keep the local player only. The single-player step is unchanged (the opponent sweep's 516/517 and 508/517 hold). |
| `ai::PoliceCar` chasing the other players | `aiPoliceOfficer::DetectPerpetrator` (walks the player list), `aiMap::Player(0)` | deviation | The other players are players to the police (detected, chased, apprehended by MM2's rules); the rules that read player 0 (the reversing check) read the local player, and only the local car's hits mark what it hits. |
| `ai::World::advanceLightsTo` | `aiTrafficLightSet::Update` | openmm2 | A client's light sets run to the host's step count (they are deterministic from `aiMap::Reset`), so the received traffic stops at the lights it sees. |
| `game::TrafficHost`, `TrafficClient`, `TrafficCatalog`, `TrafficProxies`, `net::AmbientStateMsg` | | openmm2 | Replication: interest by distance with hysteresis, a packet budget (the client's cars kept at the edge), complete messages, generations for recycled slots, the client's car meeting the received cars off their rails as moving kinematic instances. The client's hit reports (`TrafficHitEvent`) went with protocol 6: the host simulates every player's car and sees the hits itself. |
| `game::TrafficPrediction` (`RailMotionTracker`, `predictRailCar`, `predictBody`), `TrafficClient`'s prediction and corrections | `mmNetObject::PositionUpdate` (a network car predicted forward from its last packet) | openmm2 | Added 2026-10-09 (protocol 6, docs/review/multiplayer-desync-traffic.md): the host stamps the traffic with its AI step's time and sends a rail car's acceleration, curvature and speed over the ground; a client shows every car at its own car's time on the host's clock (its lead over the host's simulation of it added), a rail car predicted along an arc, a body along its velocity and yaw rate, the drawing blending corrections away. MM2's network cruise has no traffic; MM2 predicts its network cars forward, which this does for the host's. |
| `game::NetTrafficCars`, `TrafficBodies::Source` | `aiVehicleInstance::AttachEntity`, `aiVehicleAmbient::Impact`, `aiVehicleActive::Detach` / `PostUpdate` (the hand-over between the AI and the bodies) | openmm2 | Added 2026-10-09: `TrafficBodies` takes its traffic through an interface (the AI's for the host and single player: the same calls in the same order); a shared-traffic client gives it the received rail cars, which its own car (and a car it knocked) knocks loose at once with the host's physics; the local body leads until it rests or is 3 m from the host's car, then the host's messages (at once when the host did not knock the car). |
| `phys::Instance::kinematicMotion`, `Body::kinematicMoves` | | openmm2 | A kinematic instance (network car) that reports its motion strikes as a car moving at it (MM2 has no kinematic instances); off by default, on for the network cars of a shared-traffic cruise and the received traffic and police. |
| The host settings' SHARED TRAFFIC panel (`HostSettingsPage`) | `HostRaceMenu` (no traffic or cop settings) | deviation | On / off and the single-player cruise's traffic and cop density sliders (defaults 0.5 and 1, `RaceMenuBase::SetStateRace`), drawn by OpenMM2 in the upper right panel cruise leaves empty. |
| A client's pedestrians and the received cars | `aiPedestrian::UpcomingAccident` / `Accident` (`aiObstacle::InAccident` in the road's section lists) | inferred | The host's section lists do not travel: a received car off its rail counts for its whole road or intersection (`MapView::mapComponent` of its place). |
| A client's police cars' damage (`game::DamageReplica`, `VehicleEffects`, `AmbientEntity::damage`) | `vehCarDamage::Update`, `ApplyImpact`, `fxTexelDamage::ApplyDamage`, `vehBreakableMgr::Eject`, `vehCarModel::EjectOneshot` on the host's cars | openmm2 | Added 2026-10-09 (protocol 4): the host's police damage level (10 bits) drives the received car's smoke as `vehCarDamage::Update` does, and its dents, broken parts, sparks, shards and impact sounds are replayed from the host's records (docs/multiplayer.md, "Damage"); the wreck (out of action) as before, with its black smoke and the explosion sound. Before, a client saw the wreck flag and the explosion only. |
| A client's knocked traffic cars' wheels (`AmbientEntity::wheels`, `game::trafficWheelMatrices`) | `aiVehicleInstance::Draw` with an `aiVehicleActive` (`vehWheelCheap`'s drawing matrices) | openmm2 | Added 2026-10-09 (protocol 4): a car with a body on the host sends its four wheels' drawing offsets; the client draws it on them and lays its shadow as a physical car's. Before, it was drawn on its rail wheels. |

## Missing

| MM2 | What it does | Status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `mmJoystick::SetDeadZone` applied through `mmInput::Init` / `mmInput::SetDeadZone` | Joystick X/Y dead zone from the Options slider (default 0.1), with DirectInput rescaling the rest of the range | open: the device layer reads raw axes; the session area's input mapping (`RaceScreen`) should apply the stored dead zone the way DirectInput does instead of its fixed 0.15 threshold. |
| `mmPlayer::UpdateFF`, `mmPlayer::FFImpactCallback`, `mmPlayer::ResetFF`, `mmCarRoadFF`, `mmJoystick` effects (`SetShake`, `PlaySteer`, `PlayCollision`, `SetFriction`), `mmInput::SetForceFeedbackScale` | Force feedback: road feel, steering centring, impact jolts | open: `Input::rumbleGamepad` and `rumbleJoystick` exist but nothing drives them; porting the mmPlayer force-feedback updates belongs to the vehicle/session areas. |
| `ebolaPlayMovie` skip and size rules | The logo movie stops on Escape, Space or the left mouse button (checked every 250 ms), plays at its own size centred on the desktop and pauses while the game is inactive | open for the rendering-fx area: `IntroScreen` skips on any key, mouse button or pad button and scales the movie to the 640x480 space. The inactive pause now happens through the main loop. |
| `mmJaxis::Capture`, `mmJaxis::ResetCapture` | Axis capture for control binding: an axis is assigned once it moves 0.125 from where it rested | frontend-ui area (binding pages). |
| `datReplay` (`datTimeManager::Update` records or replays each frame's time) | Debug replay of frame timing | not needed: development feature. |
| `datTimeManager::FixedFrame`, `datTimeManager::SetTempOverSampling` | Fixed-frame mode and physics oversampling | phys-core area (`World::advanceOversampled`, `World::step`). |
