// Race opponent driving a physics car (phys::CarSim with its vehicle's own
// tune: MM2 builds AI cars with vehCar::Init(<car>) like the player's) along
// its .opp route: MM2's aiRouteRacer, an aiVehiclePhysics
// (ai::PhysicsDriver) given its route once (aiRouteRacer::DriveRoute ->
// RegisterRoute):
//   * aiRouteRacer::Init reads the .opp rows: the first is the grid place and
//     heading, the last the destination, and each row between names the
//     intersection of the PSDL room it lies in (the room's first
//     intersection component): those are the waypoints. Circuits drive them
//     `laps` times, other races once;
//   * on its first frame after Reset the racer registers the route and holds
//     the ambient traffic at its first waypoint (aiIntersection::StopSources);
//   * the [Opponent] line of the race's .aimap tunes the driver
//     (aiRaceData; see OpponentSettings::fromData);
//   * held at the start it revs in neutral with the brakes on (undrivable);
//   * a car that falls through the world is disabled (no more driving), a wrecked
//     car is repaired after 5 s in circuits only.
// MM2 has no rubber-banding: nothing scales the opponents by race position.
//
// OpenMM2 also lays the .opp route out as an ai::Course along the roads, to
// measure the racer's progress (race positions, laps) and to put a car that
// has made no progress for a long time back on its route (not in MM2).
//
// Per frame, before the physics step:
//   opponent.setHeld(!session.racersReleased() || !session.opponentActive(i));
//   opponent.update(dt, cars);
// A racer that crosses the finish line drives on to its destination (MM2's
// game only reads aiRouteRacer::Finished, here finished(): the line the race
// gave aiMap::SetWaypoints, see setFinishLine); finish() is for tools and
// tests.
